===== Software Requirements =====
Quacky has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS only. We require

- Linux 4.4.0-198 or higher, 64-bit
- Python 3.8 or higher
- latest version of Git
- latest version of pip3
- latest version of ABC (see INSTALL)
- Python 3 packages in requirements.txt (see INSTALL)

===== Hardware Requirements =====
Quacky does not require any specific hardware. However, to best reproduce our
results, we recommend 128+ GB RAM. On machines with less memory (e.g. laptops
and virtual machine instances), the experiments will take longer to run because
ABC consumes a lot of memory during execution. For our experiments, we used

- Intel i5 3.5GHz X4 processor
- 128 GB DDR3 RAM
